Summary of different theories about forgetting in psychology Saul McLeod

memory loss vs. retrieval failure
The functions of contexts in associative learning

Gonzalo P. Urcelay and Ralph R. Miller

Context can both act as a cue and modulator in conditioning (not mutually exclusive)
The extent of the cueing and modulatory roles of context are strongly influenced by trial spacing, amount of training, and contiguity

(Review) Failures of memory and the fate of forgotten memories

Ralph R. Miller

In contrast to the assumption held by circuit researchers (behavior is an accurate reflection of the content of memory), it is likely that no memory is ever forgotten; memories only become inactive but not irreversible loss
Forgetting is mostly due to interference of some non-target memories
For spontaneous forgetting, things that happened in the time course are the source of interference
Fan-Shaped Body Neurons in the Drosophila Brain Regulate Both Innate and Conditioned Nociceptive Avoidance

Wantong Hu, ..., Yi Zhong

FB neurons respond to electric shocks differently in each layer
Fan-shaped body neurons that are labeled by R49H02, R89E07, and C205 are required for aversive memory retrieval
Communication from Learned to Innate Olfactory Processing Centers Is Required for Memory Retrieval in Drosophila

Michael-John Dolan, ..., Gregory Jefferis

Cholinergic PD2a1/b1 receive input from cholinergic (excitatory) MBON-a2sc
Spaced aversive conditioning depresses activities (decreased CS+ responses) in MBON-a2sc and PD2a1/b1; also PD2a1/b1 are required for memory retrieval
attractive coding PNs send large input to PD2a1/b1, and PD2a1/b1 integrate inputs from PNs and MBON-a2sc
In terms of connectivity, the biggest difference between PD2a1 and PD2b1 is that PD2a1 does not project to the MB calyx while the PD2b1 does

Dopaminergic neurons write and update memories with cell-type-specific rules

Yoshinori Aso and Gerald M Rubin

a single DAN can bi-directionally alter the strength of KC-MBON synapses depending on the presence and relative timing of odor-driven KC activity; a full testing of this model awaits additional physiological measurements
Figure 5 is a summary about learning rules of each DAN
Uncovering long-term existence of a silent short-term memory trace

Maha E. Wally, ..., Kaoru Inokuchi

STM forms a silent engram which can be artificially recalled 1 day later and that this engram is stored within the hippocampal CA3-CA1 circuit
Silent STM engram remains available for activation and subsequent consolidation if the same experience is repeated within 3 days
While new protein synthesis is not involved in the same-day recall of STM, it is required for the long-term storage of its silent trace
the NMDAR signaling pathway, and potentially synaptic plasticity, are involved in the facilitated consolidation of the STM by storing and activating the silent STM trace, consecutively
A similar mechanism of reactivation underlies the storage and consolidation of the silent STM trace before and after its activation, respectively, which could reflect the necessity of post-learning sleep in preserving the STM trace, as with the LTM trace
A causal link between post-learning offline activity and the long-term storage of a silent STM trace
Social facilitation of long-lasting memory is mediated by CO2 in Drosophila

Aurelie Muria, ..., Guillaume Isabel

Being in group improves aversive memory performance in flies
This increase is mainly triggered by CO2 released by group members (an increase of internal stress level?)
The social facilitation of memory recruits specific brain structures
CO2 has an unexpected role in cognition in invertebrates
Functional and anatomical specificity in a higher olfactory centre

Shahar Frechter, ..., and Gregory Jefferis

Lateral horn neurons are genetically and anatomically defined cell types with stereotyped odor responses
LH receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from PNs while MB calyx receives only excitatory PN input
LH contains roughly 580 local neurons, whereas MB contains just one local inhibitory neuron (APL)
Neurogenetic dissection of the Drosophila lateral horn reveals major outputs, diverse behavioral functions, and interactions with the mushroom body

Michael-John Dolan, ..., and Remy Tabano

nomenclature (3-hierarchical system): primary neurite tract, anatomy group, and cell type
rarely complete polarisation in LHONs, suggesting bidirectional connections between LHLNs and LHONs
no clear internal structure in LH: LHONs also receive abundant direct input from the AL
many LHONs are presynaptic to one or more DANs
LHON-to-MBON overlap is sparse, especially axoaxonic connections onto MBONs
although artificial activation of certain LHONs drives valence behavior, no evidence for long-term effect (> 10 mins) has been shown
The biology of forgetting - a perspective

Ronald Davis and Yi Zhong

Two studies in rats showing that biochemical memory traces can persist beyond their behavioral retrieval
One is (Li and Richardson 2013), in the paper, the authors blocked NMDA receptors before conditioning, the trained rats did not show any conditioned response after two weeks. However, the rats can reacquire those memories after a second round of retraining. Interestingly, the reacquisition became independent of NMDA receptor activities.
The other is (Kim et al., 2012). In the paper, the authors measured some kinase levels in the amygdala of 16-day-old (P16) and 23-day old (P23) rats after conditioning. Although the behavioral memory of this conditioning decayed in the P16 rats two days later relative to the P23-trained rats, the elevation in the kinase level did not fall.
Olfactory processing in the lateral horn of Drosophila

Sudeshna Das Chakraborty and Silke Sachse

two odor coding strategies: dedicated pathways ("labeled line" pathways) and combinational coding
PN-LHN circuitry: two extreme tuning co-exist
some LHNs receive input only from a single glomerulus for the pheromone circuit
LHNs are broadly tuned and individual LH neurons receive input from several glomeruli
Recent advances in understanding the role of phasic dopamine activity

Wolfram Schultz

Dopamine neurons can be activated by not explicitly paired stimuli. For example, two stimuli (A and B) are presented sequentially. Then the reward occurs only with B. However, some dopamine neurons will be activated even if only A is given
Dopamine response may reflect the temporal structure of reward prediction
Dopamine response can model multiple reward distributions if multiple rewards are given with enough differences
the initial dopamine response component seems to code surprise salience rather than a full, bidirectional prediction error
For aversive coding, physical impact (e.g., pain, disgust) may be coded separated with the valence coding
Differential conditioning produces merged long-term memory in Drosophila

Bohan Zhao, ..., and Yi Zhong

single-trial training produces aversive LTMs to both CS+ and CS-
those LTMs of CS+ and CS- require new protein synthesis to consolidate
the consolidation takes at least hours
the long-term avoidances of CS+ and CS- seem to be derived from the same mLTM
LTM^CS+ and LTM^CS- were both extinguished by the re-exposure to either CS+ or CS- alone
LTM^CS+ and LTM^CS- were both abolished when the temporal interval between CS+ and CS- during training was prolonged to 20 minutes, suggesting that the formation of LTM^CS+ and LTM^CS- depends on the contingency of two shock-paired CS+ and CS- exposures, instead of temporally separated exposures
the encoding of mLTM requires aversive-reinforcing DANs
retrieval of mLTM requires output of ab KCs
long-lasting depression of responses in alpha2sc MBONs underlies mLTM expression
Extinction of Instrumental (Operant) Learning: Interference, Context, and Contextual Control

Mark E. Bouton

In this paper, the figure below shows all possible mechanisms by which a context might control a free operant response. (For classical conditioning, I think we just need to replace R-O with S-O.

An update on contextual fear memory mechanisms: transition between amygdala and hippocampus

Nicholas Chaaya, ..., and Luke R. Johnson

There are three possible renewal paradigms from mouse literature (ABA, ABC, and AAB), ABA is the strongest, while ABC and AAB paradigms sometimes are hard to reproduce
There are three features about renewal effects:

Has been seen in almost every conditioning preparation
Can occur after very extensive extinction training
the role of context is different from the standard models (context is merely another CS). The implication is that contexts modulate or "set the occasion" for the current CS-US or CS-no-US association.
Reduction of contextual control of conditioned responses by extended Pavlovian training in an insect

Misato Sato, ..., and Makoto Mizunami

the authors showed in crickets' Pavlovian conditioning, a conditioned response (CR) is initially sensitive to devaluation of the US but becomes insensitive to it after extended training
the CR is less context-dependent after extended training, in contrast to what occurs after standard training, where context specificity is observed
US value-insensitive CR after extended training is indeed less context-specific
the number of conditioning trials does not reduce the context specificity of the CR
Mushroom body efferent neurons responsible for aversive olfactory memory retrieval in Drosophila

Julien Sejourne, ..., Thomas Preat

MB-V2 neurons are essential for retrieval of both short- and long-lasting aversive memories, but not for memory formation or memory consolidation
MB-V2 neurons are cholinergic efferent neurons that project from the mushroom body vertical lobes to the middle superiormedial protocerebrum and the lateral horn
the odor response of MB-V2 neurons is modified after conditioning
As the lateral horn has been implicated in innate responses to repellent odorants, the authors propose that MB-V2 neurons recruit the olfactory pathway involved in innate odor avoidance during memory retrieval
The temporal dynamics of retention of a context memory: Something is missing

Jerry Rudy and Karli Wirght-Hardesty

The authors used a context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE) to study the retention of a context memory. CPFE consists of three phases: 1. pre-exposure to the context; 2. immediate shock; 3. test for conditioned freezing. The retention interval separates pre-exposure and immediate shock.

Retention of the context memory is a U-shape function of the retention interval, with 5 min retrieval at the lowest
Memory for context rapidly becomes inaccessible (~ 2 min)
Two pre-exposure sessions make the context memory retrievable at 5 min
The flat part of the U is unlikely a product of the nature of the retrieval experience
The context memory can last more than 28 days
Independent Contributions of Discrete Dopaminergic Circuits to Cellular Plasticity, Memory Strength, and Valence in Drosophila

Tamara Boto, ... and Seth M. Tomchik

Dopaminergic plasticity at the cellular level maps to PPL2, not PPL1 neurons
the PPL2 subset of TH+ dopaminergic neurons is responsible for the cellular-level Ca2+ response plasticity observed in the MB g lobes
PPL2 neurons respond to odor and shock but do not encode strong valence (artificial training does not produce any memory, the timing of testing is not given, maybe it's immediate test?)
Activating PPL2 neurons during paired shock-CS+ presentation facilitates memory, while activating those neurons after the presentation has no effect. - The electrophysiological evidence shows that PPL2 stimulation enhances MB responses to a paired odor, and there was no detectable interaction with electric shock
No loss-of-function effect was found with PPL2 neurons
Dopamine Neurons Mediate Learning and Forgetting through Bidirectional Modulation of a Memory Trace

Jacob A. Berry, ... and Ronald L. Davis

The output of MBON-r2a'1 is required for aversive memory retrieval
Activation of DAN-r2a'1 depresses synaptic connection to MBON-r2a'1 when there's coincidence with CS, while restoring the connection when there's no coincidence
The authors only tested active (artificial) short-term forgetting, but no spontaneous long-term forgetting
Forgetting, Reminding, and Remembering: The Retrieval of Lost Spatial Memory

Livia de Hoz, ... and Richard Morris 2004

Giving partially lesioned rats a reminder (the stage) leads to reactivation of a dormant place memory
Since the reminder stage is given at two different places (new and original location), it gives a protocol to differentiate "storage failure" and "retrieval failure"
Differential role for a defined lateral horn neuron subset in naive odor valence in Drosophila

Hadas Lerner, ... and Moshe Parnas 2020

(Fig 3) suggests that PD2a1/b1 neurons mediate avoidance behavior to odors in satiated flies at the relatively high odor concentration of 10^-2 used;
the contribution of PD2a1/b1 neurons to odor avoidance behavior is concentration-dependent and time-dependent (in a timescale of seconds)
By the loss of function experiment in olfactory conditioning, PD2a1/b1 neurons are shown to contribute to aversive conditioning, most likely by changing the innate odor valence than direct participation in the conditioning
LH neurons, KCs, and fan-shaped body neurons are possible downstream integrators of PD2a1/b1 neurons and that MB-processed information is returned to the LH via MBON-b'2mp
A plausible motif to explain the results in Fig. S7
Dissecting neural pathways for forgetting inDrosophilaolfactory aversive memory

Yichun Shuai, ... and Yi Zhong 2015

Identified two sets of neurons (PAM-b'1 and MBON-r4>r1r2) that account for the rapid forgetting of early olfactory aversive memory
Inactivating those neurons inhibits memory decay without altering learning, whereas activating them promotes forgetting
Those two sets of neurons are not required for acute forgetting during reversal learning
Long-term memory is formed immediately without the need for protein synthesis-dependent consolidation in Drosophila

Bohan Zhao, ... and Yi Zhong 2019

Single-trial conditioning yields cLTM that is formed immediately and sustained over 14 days
cLTM recall requires both the conditioned odor and every component of the context
This cLTM is mediated through lateral-horn neurons
